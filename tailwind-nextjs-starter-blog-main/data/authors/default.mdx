I am a Senior Salesforce Developer with 6.6 years of extensive experience in the Salesforce ecosystem, currently working at Virtusa Technologies. My expertise lies in designing and developing scalable solutions using Apex, Lightning Web Components (LWC), and complex Integrations.

Throughout my career, I have focused on building robust business processes, optimizing system performance, and implementing high-security standards. I am passionate about solving real-time project challenges and staying updated with the latest Salesforce releases to deliver cutting-edge solutions.

In my professional journey, I have successfully led several integration projects and handled end-to-end deployments. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy mentoring junior developers to achieve project goals efficiently.
